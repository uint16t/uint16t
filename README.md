### Hey!
I'm `uint16t`, or `unsigned` for short! I call myself a ***computer enthusiast***, instead of a 'hobbyist developer', as I don't program as often as I'd like and much rather enjoy *researching* <sup>(not always applying)</sup> the, as I like to call it, *low\[er\]-level, abstract concepts* (varying from Operating Systems to Computer Architecture). Though, I might need to add: **While I may talk enthusiastically about the various sub-topics within computing, I'm not an expert in any of it and my knowledge is very basic, often barely scratching the surface of the subjects mentioned.**

More recently, I've been enjoying toying around with basic **reverse engineering**, as it pulls ~~requires~~ knowledge from a variety of different 'sub-topics' within computing. It's also been a blast learning **x86** so far, and basic R.E. has really helped consolidate a few ideas (such as stack frames, jump tables, etc.). 


**If, for whatever reason, you need to contact me, my e-mail *(& PGP key)* is provided above.** 
<sub>An archaic communication method, I know, but while I do use other platforms: I currently choose to not place them on this page - but may do in the future.</sub>
