### Plans: 
 - **Ethical Hacking/Reverse Engineering** : Ever since I've touched a computer, I've always found the art of hacking (both, the traditional and modern sense) quite fascinating, even if I was a script-kiddie. Now, I want to look more into reverse engineering as a practical hobby!
 - **PCB Development/Circuitry** : Even though I'm all about low-level programming, I have barely touched the surface of actual circuit development, so, it'd be cool to create open-source and practical hardware which I could program my self! The small element of design that is associated with creating good and beautiful PCB's is something that appeals to me, so, hopefully, I can start it soon!
 - **OS Development** : Ah, good old OS dev... I'm still researching the theory-side of the topic and have yet to put that (minimal) knowledge into use, but hopefully I can have something notable to show in the future!
 - **Compiler/Interpreter Development** : Creating a programming language doesn't interest me as much as the other two mentioned above, but is still something that is worth venturing into...
 
<sub>I *may* delete this file in the future - as it really isn't needed that much. It's just nicer to keep a more 'minimal' approach when it comes design, hence why I have taken the plans away from the `README.md`</sub>
